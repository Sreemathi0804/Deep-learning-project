This deep learning project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The primary goal was to develop a working deep learning model using TensorFlow that can accurately classify images into one of ten categories. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images, each of size 32x32 pixels, spread evenly across ten classes such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. It is widely used for benchmarking image classification models and is readily available through the Keras library.

The model was implemented using Python in a Google Colab environment, making use of libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib. The data was normalized, and a CNN architecture was constructed using several convolutional layers followed by max pooling, flattening, and dense layers. The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and trained using the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification tasks. The training process was carried out over 10 epochs with validation using a test dataset.

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 70–75% on the test set, which is a good result for a basic CNN trained without extensive tuning. Visualizations of the training and validation accuracy and loss were generated using Matplotlib, providing a clear picture of the model’s learning process. This project successfully demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world image classification problems using CNNs and TensorFlow.
